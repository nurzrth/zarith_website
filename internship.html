                <p> 
                    From 22 July 2024 to 13 September 2024, I had the privilege of undertaking an internship at 
                    <a href="https://hkl.moh.gov.my/index.php/en/">Hospital Kuala Lumpur</a>, one of Malaysia's largest 
                    and most prestigious medical institutions. 
                    As an Information Management student, this internship provided me with a platform to bridge 
                    the gap between academic learning and real-world application in a professional healthcare environment.
                    Positioned within the hospital’s 
                    <a href="https://hkl.moh.gov.my/index.php/en/about-us/department/management/information-technology">Information Technology Department</a>, 
                    my role encompassed a wide range 
                    of responsibilities, offering me a comprehensive view of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> 
                    operations in a healthcare setting.
                    One of my primary tasks was the installation of agents for the <i>Sistem Pengurusan Aset dan ICT</i> 
                    <abbr title="ICT and Asset Management System / Sistem Pengurusan Aset dan ICT">(SPAI)</abbr> 
                    on government <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> assets across various departments, a critical 
                    process for asset tracking and 
                    data security. This included verifying <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> hostnames and 
                    ensuring each asset was correctly registered 
                    in the system. My work took me to numerous divisions, including the Human Resources Division, 
                    Radiotherapy and Nuclear Departments, and several units under the Medical and Surgical Directorates, 
                    where I collaborated with staff members and fellow interns to meet organizational objectives.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
                    In addition to these technical tasks, I was entrusted with administrative duties, such as managing 
                    documentation at the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Department counter, assisting 
                    staff with hardware and printer requisitions, 
                    and stamping and signing official documents. There were moments when I stepped in to answer calls 
                    and resolve inquiries in the absence of senior staff, which enhanced my confidence and communication 
                    skills. Throughout this period, I encountered challenges that tested my adaptability and 
                    problem-solving abilities, such as addressing compatibility issues during agent installations and 
                    adhering to tight schedules in busy hospital departments. I also had the opportunity to get assisted 
                    by Mrs. Suhana, my senior staff, with specific tasks like reviewing documents and providing feedback 
                    on proposal evaluations, which exposed me to administrative and evaluative processes. Encik Arif, 
                    my supervisor, and Ms. Afifah, another colleague, also helped me in several ways when I was stuck on 
                    some of the work that had been given to me. They patiently taught me how to do all of the work.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
                    One of the most rewarding aspects of my internship was the chance to work with a team of dedicated 
                    professionals, including experienced staff members and my fellow interns, Syahiqah and Mustaqim. 
                    This collaborative environment not only allowed me to learn from their expertise but also taught me 
                    the value of teamwork and effective communication in achieving shared goals. There is one of the work 
                    where each of us have to create a poster regarding the launching of 
                    <abbr title="Hospital Kuala Lumpur">HKL</abbr> navigation portal. 
                    <b><a href="pdf/posterhkl.pdf" target="_blank">(Click Here)</a> to view the poster that have been 
                    created by me.</b> Moreover, a particularly memorable moment was the intern appreciation ceremony held 
                    on our final day, where all interns were recognized for their contributions and presented with 
                    certificates of completion. This gesture of appreciation underscored the hospital’s commitment to 
                    nurturing young talent and made me feel valued for my efforts.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
                    This internship has been a transformative experience, deepening my understanding of the integration 
                    of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> in healthcare and strengthening my technical, 
                    administrative, and interpersonal skills. It has 
                    also solidified my interest in health information management and inspired me to pursue further growth 
                    in this field. The knowledge and experiences I gained during these eight weeks have not only prepared 
                    me for future professional challenges but also instilled in me a sense of pride and purpose in 
                    contributing to the betterment of healthcare services. I am immensely grateful for this opportunity 
                    and consider it a significant milestone in my journey toward a fulfilling career in information 
                    management. Overall, it is good internship placement who want to seek out a new things.

                                                heartwarming event designed to appreciate the contributions 
                                                of the interns during their time at the institution. Held on the final 
                                                day of our internship, the celebration brought together the Information 
                                                Technology Department staff and the interns in a casual yet meaningful 
                                                gathering. The room was filled with a sense of joy as we 
                                                reminisced about the journey we had shared, reflecting on both the 
                                                challenges we had faced and the accomplishments we had achieved. 
                                                The event remind me the importance of collaboration and 
                                                the impact each individual could make when working towards a common goal.

                                                by our supervisors and colleagues, who expressed their gratitude for our 
                                                efforts and the enthusiasm we brought to our tasks. Their kind words were 
                                                both encouraging and motivating, as they highlighted the skills and 
                                                qualities we had demonstrated during our internship. As interns, we also 
                                                had the opportunity to share our experiences, expressing our gratitude 
                                                for the guidance and support we received throughout our journey. Although 
                                                I initially felt a little shy about making a communication in front of 
                                                the whole crowd, I was able to overcome it. The 
                                                exchange of stories and reflections created a warm and uplifting 
                                                atmosphere, further strengthening the bonds between us and the team 
                                                members.

                                                symbolizing the unity and teamwork that had defined our time at the 
                                                hospital. The celebration was a perfect way to end our internship, 
                                                leaving us with lasting memories and a sense of fulfillment. It not only 
                                                marked the conclusion of a significant chapter in our professional 
                                                development but also inspired us to carry forward the lessons we had 
                                                learned into our future endeavors. The Internship Students Celebration 
                                                was more than just an event, it was a testament to the value of mutual 
                                                respect, hard work, and the lasting relationships forged during our time

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">The last day of an internship is a bittersweet milestone, marking the 
                                                end of an enriching chapter and the beginning of new opportunities. It is 
                                                a moment where I can reflect on the skills that I have learned, the relationships built, and 
                                                the challenges overcome during the internship journey. At Hospital Kuala 
                                                Lumpur, my last day was filled with mixed emotions as I completed my 
                                                final tasks and prepared to bid farewell to a workplace that had become 
                                                a significant part of my life. The day began with a sense of fulfillment 
                                                as I wrapped up loose ends, ensured a smooth handover of responsibilities, 
                                                and expressed my gratitude to the team that guided me throughout my internship.

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">One of the highlights of the day was sharing heartfelt goodbyes with 
                                                the colleagues and mentors who had supported me during this transformative 
                                                period. Their advice and encouragement had been invaluable, and I took the 
                                                opportunity to personally thank them for their patience, guidance, and 
                                                trust. My fellow interns and I reminisced about the memorable moments we 
                                                shared, from navigating challenging tasks to celebrating small victories 
                                                together. It was also a time to exchange contact information, ensuring we 
                                                stayed connected as we pursued our respective career paths. The 
                                                camaraderie built during the internship made the farewell particularly 
                                                poignant, as it underscored the depth of the bonds we had formed. Both 
                                                supervisors above also were especially kind and supportive to the interns,
                                                always taking the time to explain tasks clearly, offer helpful feedback, 
                                                and make sure we felt included in the team. Their kindness created a 
                                                welcoming and positive atmosphere, which made learning and growing easier.

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">As the day drew to a close, I left the hospital with a profound sense 
                                                of gratitude and accomplishment. The internship had been a stepping stone 
                                                in my professional journey, equipping me with practical skills and 
                                                experiences that would shape my future. It also instilled in me a deeper 
                                                understanding of the importance of teamwork, resilience, and adaptability 
                                                in a real-world setting. While it was difficult to say goodbye, the 
                                                lessons and memories from my time at Hospital Kuala Lumpur remain a 
                                                cherished part of my life, inspiring me to approach future endeavors 
                                                with confidence and determination. I hope to experience the hospital 
                                                work environment again during my future degree internship.
